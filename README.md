# Flow Redux Playground
Playground project used to study new stuff

Stack:
- **FlowRedux**: a state/event library based on Redux, similar to an MVI but without the concept of Intent and IntentFactory
- **Android Jetpack Compose**: we love declarative UI
- **GraphQL**: let's start to learn it, we are using the Github schema, it's public and authenticated
- **Mockk**: I love it, mocking library for unit test and so on
- **Arrow.io**: `Either` is the way
- **Clean architecture**: as usual
- **Dagger Hilt**: DI everywhere
